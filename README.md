##### git clone
For full obsidian integration clone the 'secret-journal'
-> that includes this 'public journal' as a submodule.

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/oryon-dominik/secret-journal

    git submodule add https://github.com/oryon-dominik/journal public
    git submodule set-branch --branch trunk public
